The Binomial iCAR model is a linear Binomial logistic regression model including an intrinsic Conditional Autoregressive (iCAR) process to account for the spatial autocorrelation of the observations. Parameter inference is done in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. The `.model_binomial_iCAR()` function from the `deforestprob` module includes a Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm written in pure C code to reduce computation time.\n",

The variance of the spatial random effects (`Vrho`) is given together with the deviance value, which can be used to compare different statistical models (lower deviance is better).

We select the following accuracy indices: the Overall Accuracy (OA), the Specificity (Spe), the Sensitivity (Sen), Cohen's Kappa (K), the True Skill Statistics (TSS) and the Figure Of Merit (FOM). These indices are classical indices used to estimate the accuracy of deforestation models (see for example Dezécache et al. 2017, Vieilledent et al. 2013 and Pontius et al. 2011).\n",

Here we are interested in seeing if our model is predicting well the location of the deforestation (relative deforestation probability), not the intensity of deforestation (absolute deforestation probability). We then transform the predicted probability of deforestation into binary values using the deforestation probability \"observed\" in the sampling data-set. This last value should be closed to 0.5 as we sampled as many forest and non-forest pixels, at the exception of the pixels with no-data value for environmental variables. The same proportion of deforested pixels will be applied to the predictions selecting the pixels with the highest predicted deforestation probabilities."
